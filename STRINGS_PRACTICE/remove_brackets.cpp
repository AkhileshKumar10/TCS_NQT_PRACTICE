// Of course! Let's go through the changes made in the code and why they were necessary:

// 1. **Updated `new_string` initialization**: In the original code, `new_string` was initialized with a space character `" "`. This would result in an extra space at the beginning of the `new_string`. To avoid this, I changed the initialization to an empty string `""`.

// 2. **Changed logical OR (`||`) to logical AND (`&&`) in the if condition**: The original code used logical OR (`||`) in the if condition, meaning that if any one of the conditions was true, the character would be added to `new_string`. This wasn't the desired behavior because you want to exclude characters `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `<`, and `>` from `s`. So, I changed the logical OR to logical AND (`&&`) to ensure that all conditions must be true for the character to be excluded.

// 3. **Adjusted the loop condition**: The loop condition `i < s.size()` is fine and remains unchanged. It ensures that we iterate over each character in the input string `s`.

// By making these changes, the function `remove_brackets` now properly removes the specified brackets from the input string `s`, and the rectified code should work as intended.
